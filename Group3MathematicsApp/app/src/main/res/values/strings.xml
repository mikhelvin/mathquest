    <string name="title1">Question 2 - The Jester at the gate:</string>
    <string name="context1">The passcode was correct! At the end of the moat, Calcebra\'s jester blocks your way. He draws a card at random from a deck of cards and asks you to guess its suit.</string>
    <string name="contextF1">Well, you got the passcode wrong so you resorted to swimming past the alligators. That was not a good idea.\n\nAs you make it to the other side of the moat, Calcebra\'s jester blocks your way. He draws a card at random from a deck of cards and asks you to guess its suit.</string>
    <string name="content1">Assuming a deck of cards has 52 cards, and 13 of each suit, what is the percentage probability that the card\'s suit is spades? (ex. 60 percent would be 0.60)</string>
    <string name="answer1">0.25</string>

    <string name="title2">Question 3 - Enter the courtyard:</string>
    <string name="context2">The jester is amazed at your mathematical prowess and lets you through. You walk into a courtyard filled with numerous trees. Suddenly, the trees come alive and ensnare you with their branches. A magical vine hands you a scroll with another problem to solve, seemingly unwilling to let you go until you provide it with an answer.

    <string name="contextF2">The jester looks disappointed, then attacks you. Despite being hurt a bit from the fight, you manage to subdue him and progress into a courtyard filled with numerous trees. Suddenly, the trees come alive and ensnare you with their branches. A magical vine hands you a scroll with another problem to solve, seemingly unwilling to let you go until you provide it with an answer. The druid of the forest is choosing three of the ten trees to animate into treants.

    <string name="content2">How many ways can you pick three members of a group of ten if order does not matter?
</string>
    <string name="answer2">120</string>

    <string name="title3">Question 4 - The Grand Hall:</string>
    <string name="context3">The druid likes your answer and lets you go. You find your way to the Grand Hall. The hall is dark, but there is a flickering circuit beside you. The button does not work, but there is a dial and a formula to calculate the voltage that the circuit should receive.</string>
    <string name="contextF3">The druid did not like your answer, and you hurt yourself when you use your knife to cut yourself free. At the end of the courtyard, you find your way to the Grand Hall. The hall is dark, but there is a flickering circuit beside you. The button does not work, but there is a dial and a formula to calculate the voltage that the circuit should receive. Lightly glowing, the formula reads:</string>
    <string name="content3">The circuit in front of you takes a maximum voltage \"the limit as x approaches two, of 8 – 3x + 12x^2\". What voltage should the circuit receive?</string>
    <string name="answer3">50</string>

    <string name="title4">Question 5 - The Dungeon Entrance:</string>
    <string name="context4">You hear a resonating hum, and a solitary light turns on above one of the doors indicating that it is the one you need. However, it seems to be locked and the only way to open it is to solve the riddle you find engraved around the door frame.</string>
    <string name="contextF4">You fumble with the circuit to no avail, and resort to finding the door manually. You stumble and fall a few times but eventually find the correct one labeled "DUNGEON ENTRANCE". However, it seems to be locked and the only way to open it is to solve the riddle you find engraved around the door frame.</string>
    <string name="content4">\"I am a graph with four vertices and six edges. Can I exist?\"\n\nAnswer 1 for yes or 0 for no.</string>
    <string name="answer4">1</string>

    <string name="title5">Question 6 - Freeing the Princess:</string>
    <string name="context5">The door hears your answer, and seemingly alive, swings upon with a ceremonious thud. You enter the dungeon and find Princess Trig held by Calcebra. You immediately notice that something is not right about the scene in front of you.</string>
    <string name="contextF5">The door does not open. You smash at it with your fists and, seemingly hurt, the door swings upon with a ceremonious thud. However, you receive a few splinters in your hand. You progress through the dungeon and find Princess Trig held by Calcebra. You immediately notice that something is not right about the scene in front of you. Everything seems to be upside down.</string>
    <string name="content5">Let the image in front of you be represented by a 2-D vector in the form of (x, y). What do you multiply the y-coordinate by in order to reflect the image about the x-axis?</string>
    <string name="answer5">-1</string>

    <string name="title6">Question 7 – Past The Illusion:</string>
    <string name="context6">You flip the image in front of you and discover that it is an illusion. You feel the floor under you give way, and you are able to roll as you fall to the level below you. There is a golden shield in front of you, but it\'s locked behind a combination.</string>

    <string name="answer6">720</string>

    <string name="title7">Question 8 – Another Useful Tool:</string>
    <string name="context7">Realizing that 720 combinations is too much, you search around the room for another way to retrieve the shield. You find a lever, pull it, and retrieve the shield from the wall. You discover a sword behind it with the same locking mechanism.</string>
    <string name="contextF7">You figure that there aren\'t too many combinations to enter, and you start guessing. By the time you are finished, your fingers become sore. You unlock the shield and discover a sword behind it with the same locking mechanism.</string>
    <string name="content7">How many possible permutations exist for the letters in the word \“SWORD\”?</string>
    <string name="answer7">120</string>

    <string name="title8">Question 9 – Three Paths</string>
    <string name="context8">You unlock the sword with ease and press on. You discover three paths in front of you, but there\'s a map. The map is given in the format of a binary search tree, with the way out given in the right child.</string>
    <string name="contextF8">Your fingers become raw as you enter all the possible permutations manually, and eventually guess the answer and take the sword. You discover three paths in front of you, but there\'s a map. The map is given in the format of a binary search tree, with the way out given in the right child.</string>
    <string name="content8">The binary search tree in front of you has three nodes consisting of 1, 4, and 7. The root is 4. The right child of the root has what value?</string>
    <string name="answer8">7</string>

    <string name="title9">Question 10 - Three Paths, Part II</string>
    <string name="context9">You take the path labeled 7 and gleefully press on. You find another three paths, and they diverge in the same fashion. However, the root of the tree is indicated as the right way out.</string>
    <string name="contextF9">You are not convinced that your answer is particularly correct after running into a swarm of stinging bees. After receiving a few painful stings, you double back to take the path labeled with 7 instead. You find another three paths, and they diverge in the same fashion. However, the root of the tree is indicated as the right way out.</string>
    <string name="content9">The binary search tree in front of you has three nodes consisting of 78, 32, and 45. The left child has a value of 32. Which number must its parent be?</string>
    <string name="answer9">45</string>

    <string name="title10">Question 11 - The Final Three Paths</string>
    <string name="context10">You take the correct path, so it would seem. It leads to what looks like the exit, until you walk into an illusory wall. With a hurt head, you double back and head onto another path. The final three doors await. The answer is given to you with a binary search tree\'s root.</string>
    <string name="contextF10">You are not sure which path to follow and take the one directly in front of you. It leads to what looks like the exit, until you walk into an illusory wall.
